Warning! Results should be treated with caution given the following:,,,,,,,,,
There is 9% missing data at the locus 'LIST2013' in the population 'Pop1!,,,,,,,,,
There is 7% missing data at the locus 'VMA3' in the population 'Pop1!,,,,,,,,,
There is 26% missing data at the locus 'LIST2004' in the population 'Pop1!,,,,,,,,,
There is 28% missing data at the locus 'LIST2011' in the population 'Pop1!,,,,,,,,,
There is 14% missing data at the locus 'VMA6' in the population 'Pop1!,,,,,,,,,
There is 10% missing data at the locus 'Rufa19' in the population 'Pop1!,,,,,,,,,
