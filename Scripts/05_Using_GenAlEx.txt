# ANALYSING BWS DATA IN GENALEX

# 1. Setting up ----

# In Data folder, there are two files: 
# 08a_BWS_Data_50_NoSibs_2017_GenAlEx.csv and 08b_BWS_Data_50_NoSibs_2018_GenAlEx.csv
# These have been prepared to match GenAlEx format in R 

# Download GenAlEx plugin for Microsoft Excel and click on the download to open the Plugin in Excel 

# To analyse the data:
# Open the data file in Excel (right click, open with > Microsoft Excel)

# 2. Preparing data ---- 

# Necessary to add in parameters for GenAlEx to work
# This must be done manually 

# Parameter values:
# A1 = Number of loci
# B1 = Sample size (number of individuals)
# C1 = Number of populations (n)
# D1 + [CELL = (n-1)]1 = Number of individuals per population (use as many cells as necessary in that row)

# Parameters > Insert Header Rows and Params 
# This inserts x2 rows, with for: 
# 2017: B1 = 97, C1 = 1, D1 = 97. Type "12" to A1 (no loci)
# 2018: B1 = 184, C1 = 1, D1 = 184. Type "13" to A1.

# 3. Analysing the data ----

# Get allelic frequencies:
# Frequency based > Frequency > [Check data] > Frequency by Pop + Het && Poly by Pop 

# This creates 2 new sheets 

# AFP = Allelic frequencies by Pop
# HFP = Heterozygosity, Fstatistics and Polymorphism by Population 

# Note: Because we are only considering these data as one population, we can tick wither Het && Poly by Pop (HFP) or Het && Poly by Locus (HFL)
# HFP and HFL give the same results.

# To save the results, it is necessary to save this document as an .xls file (Excel 97-2004). 

# Exporting files ----

# These files then need to be exported in two different formats for further analyses 
# 1. GenPop as a .txt file 
# 2. Microchecker
